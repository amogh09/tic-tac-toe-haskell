# Sample Haskell Console App: tic-tac-toe
I have created this project to demonstrate the project structure of a simple Stack-based Haskell app. The project also demonstrates some unit testing capabilities in Haskell using QuickCheck and HSpec. Some basic I/O testing is also shown.

## How to run?
```
stack exec tic-tac-toe-exe
```

## Example run
```
âžœ  tic-tac-toe git:(master) stack exec tic-tac-toe-exe
